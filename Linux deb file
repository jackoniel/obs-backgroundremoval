Hy
i am quite shure i am wrong here. But thats ok for me. That way you can see i am capable to find you but you may as well see 
i am not abel to compile a deb file witch i need out of the source code. I very much like your idea since zoom has an automated backroundremoval 
obs should have a backround removal to - shure. so ..great job. 
I would just love it to be able to use your idea. But since i use Debian and no one in the world will ever bring me back to windows not even Mac any more.
Well i need your help. 
And i am quite shure a few tousend people in the world are thinking the same. maby more in time.
but you are the one on the MIT and we outside here are not so familiar with the technical backround
So if you could please be so kind ...
Theres not much more i can say acept Thanks in advance.
